Raw tracklets from the standard Kanade-\r\nLucas-Tomasi tracking algorithm are treated as sample\r\npoints and grouped to form different vehicle candidates.\r\nEach tracklet is described by multiple features including position,\r\nvelocity, and a foreground score derived from robust\r\nPCA background subtraction. By considering each tracklet\r\nas a node in a graph, we build the adjacency matrix for\r\nthe graph based on the feature similarity between the tracklets\r\nand group these tracklets using spectral embedding and\r\nDirichelet Process Gaussian Mixture Models. The proposed\r\nsystem yields excellent performance for traffic videos captured\r\nin urban environments and highways.\r\n\r\n![Foreground Blobs](https://github.com/ChengeLi/VehicleTracking/blob/master/SiteFigures/blobs.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![Intermediate and Final clustered result](https://github.com/ChengeLi/VehicleTracking/blob/master/SiteFigures/initial_group_and_clustered.jpg?raw=true)\r\n## Publications:\r\nChenge Li, An-Ti Chiang, Gregory Dobler, Yao Wang, Kun Xie, Kaan Ozbay, Masoud Ghandehari, Jiaxu Zhou, Di Wang, \"Robust Vehicle Tracking for Urban Traffic Videos at Intersections.\" Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), 2016 13th IEEE International Conference on.
