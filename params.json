Raw tracklets from the standard Kanade-\r\nLucas-Tomasi tracking algorithm are treated as sample\r\npoints and grouped to form different vehicle candidates.\r\nEach tracklet is described by multiple features including position,\r\nvelocity, and a foreground score derived from robust\r\nPCA background subtraction. By considering each tracklet\r\nas a node in a graph, we build the adjacency matrix for\r\nthe graph based on the feature similarity between the tracklets\r\nand group these tracklets using spectral embedding and\r\nDirichelet Process Gaussian Mixture Models. The proposed\r\nsystem yields excellent performance for traffic videos captured\r\nin urban environments and highways.\r\n\r\n![Foreground Blobs](https://github.com/ChengeLi/VehicleTracking/blob/master/SiteFigures/blobs.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![Intermediate and Final clustered result](https://github.com/ChengeLi/VehicleTracking/blob/master/SiteFigures/initial_group_and_clustered.jpg?raw=true)\r\n## Credits\r\nAn-ti Chiang, New York University,\tdawnandyknight@gmail.com \r\n\r\nChenge Li, New York University,\t   cl2840@nyu.edu\r\n\r\nGreg Dobler, New York University,  greg.dobler@nyu.edu \r\n\r\n## Information\r\nIf you have any questions or need more detailed explanations, \r\nplease email Chenge Li for further information. :D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
